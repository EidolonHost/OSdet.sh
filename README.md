# OSdet.sh
This is the OS detection script written in bash.

You are entirely welcome to submit pull requests for other OSes such as OS X, FreeBSD, etc. This script uses the presence of /etc/lsb-release to determine what OS you're running on. It will also eventually determine what package manager you're using as well as what architecture you're on, such as i386, x86_64 and so on.

I will be keeping this script updated to the best of my ability. â€” Keiro

I'd also like to note that the script may not fully work as designed. I'm still working on learning how to write a bash script properly, so if you encounter issues with this, please let me know. If you have a fix, please also let me know and submit a pull request so I can merge said fix into this script.
