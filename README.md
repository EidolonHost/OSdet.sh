# OSdet.sh
This is the OS detection script written in bash.

You are entirely welcome to submit pull requests for other OSes such as OS X, FreeBSD, etc. This script uses the presence of /etc/lsb-release to determine what OS you're running on. It will also eventually determine what package manager you're using as well as what architecture you're on, such as i386, x86_64 and so on.

I will be keeping this script updated to the best of my ability. â€” Keiro
